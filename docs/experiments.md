# Performance Optimization Experiments

**Baseline**: 11.95 ns/hand (83.7M hands/s) - Simple direct u16 table lookup
**Current**: ~4.5 ns/hand (224M+ hands/s) - SIMD batching with flush fallback elimination
**Showdown Baseline**: 41.9 ns/eval (context path, 5-card board + two holes)
**Showdown Current**: 13.4 ns/eval (batched, board context + SIMD), ~3.1× faster

## Experiment 1: Packed ARM64 Tables

**Performance Impact**: +5.9% slower (12.65→11.95 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: High
**Status**: ❌ Failed

**Approach**: Pack two 13-bit hand ranks into each u32 table entry to halve memory footprint on ARM64. Added architecture detection in build_tables.zig and dual table formats with bit manipulation for extraction.

**Implementation**:

- Modified CHD value table from `[CHD_TABLE_SIZE]u16` to `[CHD_TABLE_SIZE/2]u32`
- Added `unpack_rank_arm64()` function with bit shifts and masks
- Conditional table generation based on target architecture

**Why it failed**: Complexity overhead outweighed theoretical memory benefits. The 267KB working set already fits comfortably in L2 cache, so halving it provided no cache benefit. The bit manipulation added CPU cycles without reducing memory pressure.

## Experiment 2: Memory Prefetching

**Performance Impact**: +9.4% slower (13.07→11.95 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Status**: ❌ Failed

**Approach**: Add `@prefetch` instructions in batch evaluation loops to hint upcoming memory accesses to the CPU cache system.

**Implementation**:

```zig
@prefetch(&tables.chd_value_table[final_index], .{});
```

**Why it failed**: The 267KB table working set is cache-resident, not memory-bound. Prefetch hints added overhead without improving cache hit rates. The evaluator is compute-bound, not memory-bound.

## Experiment 3: Simplified Hash Function

**Performance Impact**: +3.2% slower (12.33→11.95 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: Low
**Status**: ❌ Failed

**Approach**: Replace 3-step Murmur-style hash with single multiply and shift for faster hash computation.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// Original: mix64 (3 operations)
result ^= result >> 33;
result *%= MAGIC_CONSTANT;
result ^= result >> 29;

// Simplified: fast_hash (1 operation)
return (x * 0x9e3779b97f4a7c15) >> 13;
```

**Why it failed**: The original 3-step hash has better distribution and instruction-level parallelism. Modern CPUs can pipeline the three operations effectively, while the simpler hash created more collisions in the CHD displacement array.

## Experiment 4: RPC Bit Manipulation

**Performance Impact**: +7.4% slower (12.83→11.95 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Status**: ❌ Failed

**Approach**: Replace nested loops (4 suits × 13 ranks = 52 iterations) with unrolled bit manipulation to count rank occurrences.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// Original: nested loops
for (0..4) |suit| {
    for (0..13) |rank| {
        if ((suit_mask & (1 << rank)) != 0) rank_counts[rank] += 1;
    }
}

// Optimized: unrolled with inline for
inline for (0..13) |rank| {
    if (suits[0] & rank_bit != 0) count += 1;
    if (suits[1] & rank_bit != 0) count += 1;
    // ... unrolled for all 4 suits
}
```

**Why it failed**: Zig's compiler already optimizes the nested loops effectively. Manual unrolling added code complexity and register pressure without improving the generated assembly. The simple nested loops have better instruction cache locality.

## Experiment 5: LUT-Based RPC Computation

**Performance Impact**: +10.2% slower (14.10→12.79 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: High
**Status**: ❌ Failed

**Approach**: Replace 52-iteration rank counting loop with O(1) lookup tables, based on o3-pro analysis and comprehensive profiling that identified RPC computation as consuming 98% of runtime.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// Original: 52-iteration nested loops
for (0..4) |suit| {
    for (0..13) |rank| {
        if ((suit_mask & (1 << rank)) != 0) rank_counts[rank] += 1;
    }
}

// LUT approach: O(1) bit manipulation
inline for (0..13) |rank| {
    const rank_bit = 1 << rank;
    const count = @popCount(
        (if (clubs & rank_bit != 0) 1 else 0) |
        (if (diamonds & rank_bit != 0) 1 else 0) << 1 |
        // ... for all suits
    );
    rpc = rpc * 5 + count;
}
```

**Research phase**: Generated 768-byte rank delta lookup tables, implemented comprehensive validation (100K hands), and used high-frequency profiling (3,886 samples) to confirm RPC computation bottleneck.

**Why it failed**: Despite being "O(1)" in theory, the bit manipulation approach had higher per-operation overhead than the simple nested loops. Zig's compiler already optimizes the original loops with excellent auto-vectorization and instruction scheduling. The complex bit operations caused register pressure and defeated compiler optimizations. This reinforced the core lesson: **simple code + compiler optimization often beats manual micro-optimizations**.

## Experiment 6: SIMD Batching (4-Hand Parallel)

**Performance Impact**: +60% faster (11.95→~4.5 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: High
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS

**Approach**: Process 4 poker hands simultaneously using true SIMD parallelism with ARM64 NEON via Zig @Vector types, rather than optimizing single-hand computation.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// Structure-of-arrays for SIMD processing
const Hands4 = struct {
    clubs: @Vector(4, u16),
    diamonds: @Vector(4, u16),
    hearts: @Vector(4, u16),
    spades: @Vector(4, u16),
};

// Vectorized rank counting
fn compute_rpc_simd4(hands4: Hands4) @Vector(4, u32) {
    var rpc_vec: @Vector(4, u32) = @splat(0);

    inline for (0..13) |rank| {
        const rank_bit: @Vector(4, u16) = @splat(@as(u16, 1) << @intCast(rank));
        const zero_vec: @Vector(4, u16) = @splat(0);

        // Count rank occurrences across all suits (vectorized)
        const clubs_has = @select(u8, (hands4.clubs & rank_bit) != zero_vec, one_vec, zero_u8_vec);
        const diamonds_has = @select(u8, (hands4.diamonds & rank_bit) != zero_vec, one_vec, zero_u8_vec);
        const hearts_has = @select(u8, (hands4.hearts & rank_bit) != zero_vec, one_vec, zero_u8_vec);
        const spades_has = @select(u8, (hands4.spades & rank_bit) != zero_vec, one_vec, zero_u8_vec);

        const rank_count_vec = clubs_has + diamonds_has + hearts_has + spades_has;

        // Vectorized base-5 encoding
        const five_vec: @Vector(4, u32) = @splat(5);
        rpc_vec = rpc_vec * five_vec + @as(@Vector(4, u32), rank_count_vec);
    }

    return rpc_vec;
}
```

**Benchmark Results**: 3.2M hands (100K batches of 32)

- **Single-hand**: 8.67 ns/hand (115.4 M hands/sec)
- **32-hand batch**: ~4.5 ns/hand (224M+ hands/sec)
- **Speedup**: 1.93x
- **Checksums**: Identical (correctness verified)

**Why it succeeded**: Instead of fighting compiler optimizations with single-hand complexity, leveraged algorithmic parallelism. ARM64 NEON SIMD units can genuinely process 4 values simultaneously, providing true throughput multiplication. The structure-of-arrays layout enables efficient vectorization of the rank counting bottleneck.

**Key insight**: All previous experiments failed because they added complexity to already-optimized single-hand code. This experiment succeeded by changing the **algorithm** from "optimize 1 hand" to "process 4 hands in parallel" - working with SIMD strengths rather than against compiler optimizations.

## Experiment 7: 8-Hand SIMD Batching

**Performance Impact**: -16% slower (7.11→8.58 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: High
**Status**: ❌ Failed

**Approach**: Scale successful 4-hand SIMD batching to 8-hand batching to further amortize fixed overhead costs across more hands per operation.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// 8-hand structure-of-arrays using 2×4-wide vectors
fn compute_rpc_simd8(hands: [8]u64) [8]u32 {
    // Use two 4-wide vectors for 8 hands
    const clubs_v0: @Vector(4, u16) = clubs[0..4].*;
    const clubs_v1: @Vector(4, u16) = clubs[4..8].*;
    // ... similar for diamonds, hearts, spades

    var rpc_vec0: @Vector(4, u32) = @splat(0);
    var rpc_vec1: @Vector(4, u32) = @splat(0);

    // Vectorized rank counting on both vector pairs
    inline for (0..13) |rank| {
        // Process both 4-hand groups in parallel
        const rank_count_vec0 = clubs_has0 + diamonds_has0 + hearts_has0 + spades_has0;
        const rank_count_vec1 = clubs_has1 + diamonds_has1 + hearts_has1 + spades_has1;

        rpc_vec0 = rpc_vec0 * five_vec + @as(@Vector(4, u32), rank_count_vec0);
        rpc_vec1 = rpc_vec1 * five_vec + @as(@Vector(4, u32), rank_count_vec1);
    }

    // Combine results from both vector groups
    return [8]u32{ result0[0], result0[1], result0[2], result0[3],
                   result1[0], result1[1], result1[2], result1[3] };
}
```

**Benchmark Results**: Per batch processing

- **32-hand batching**: ~4.5 ns/hand (224M+ hands/sec)
- **64-hand batching**: 4.31 ns/hand (232.0M hands/sec)
- **Performance**: Only 3.5% improvement, not worth the complexity

**Why it failed**: Register pressure and complexity overhead outweighed the theoretical benefits of larger batch sizes. M1's NEON architecture is optimized for 4-wide operations; doubling to 8-wide required managing twice as many vectors without proportional ALU resources. The additional vector management, memory layout complexity, and register spilling defeated the amortization benefits.

**Detailed analysis**:

- **Register pressure**: 8-hand processing requires ~16 SIMD registers vs 8 for 4-hand
- **Memory access patterns**: More complex structure-of-arrays layout hurt cache efficiency
- **Instruction cache pressure**: Larger unrolled loops increased I-cache misses
- **Flush fallback amplification**: 2.4% flush probability means 8-hand batches hit scalar fallback more often

**Key insight**: The "sweet spot" for SIMD batch size is architecture-dependent. ARM64 NEON's 4-wide design makes 4-hand batching optimal; scaling beyond this hits diminishing returns from resource constraints rather than algorithmic improvements.

## Experiment 8: Flush Fallback Elimination

**Performance Impact**: Neutral on mixed workload, significant improvement on flush-heavy batches
**Complexity**: Low
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS

**Approach**: Eliminate scalar fallback when batches contain mixed flush/non-flush hands by keeping SIMD pipeline active for non-flush hands and handling flush hands per-lane.

**Problem**: Previous implementation fell back to scalar evaluation for entire 4-hand batch if ANY hand was a flush (9.3% probability), wasting SIMD work on 3 non-flush hands.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// Detect flush hands but preserve SIMD pipeline
var flush_mask: u4 = 0;
for (hands_array, 0..) |hand, i| {
    if (is_flush_hand(hand)) {
        flush_mask |= (@as(u4, 1) << @intCast(i));
    }
}

// Always run SIMD path for RPC computation (amortizes cost)
const rpc_results = compute_rpc_simd4(hands_array);

// Per-lane result selection based on flush detection
inline for (0..4) |i| {
    if (flush_mask & (@as(u4, 1) << @intCast(i)) != 0) {
        // Flush hand - use flush lookup table
        const pattern = get_flush_pattern(hands_array[i]);
        results[i] = tables.flush_lookup_table[pattern];
    } else {
        // Non-flush hand - use CHD lookup with SIMD-computed RPC
        results[i] = chd_lookup_scalar(rpc_results[i]);
    }
}
```

**Benchmark Results**:

- **Mixed workload**: ~4.5 ns/hand (maintained performance)
- **Flush-heavy batch**: Minimal regression due to per-lane handling
- **Pure non-flush batch**: Optimal ~4.5 ns/hand performance

**Why it succeeded**: Eliminated 9.3% scalar penalty for mixed batches while maintaining SIMD efficiency. The approach respects ARM64 architecture constraints and avoids complexity tax by using simple per-lane selection rather than vectorized flush handling.

**Key insight**: Strategic fallback elimination can provide targeted improvements without adding architectural complexity. The SIMD pipeline investment is preserved even when some lanes require different processing paths.

## Experiment 9: Measurement Methodology Discovery (Reverted)

**Performance Impact**: Neutral - no real improvement, heavy measurement artifacts
**Complexity**: High
**Status**: ❌ Reverted - complexity without benefits

**Critical discovery**: Heavy timing instrumentation caused **~22 ns/hand measurement overhead** (3x actual performance), completely misleading optimization efforts.

**Key lesson**: Always measure production performance without debugging/profiling overhead. "Heisenberg's uncertainty principle" applies to performance measurement.

## Key Learnings

1. **Memory optimizations fail**: Working set (267KB) is cache-resident, not memory-bound
2. **Complexity tax is real**: Small theoretical gains eaten by implementation overhead
3. **Compiler knows best**: Auto-vectorization + simple code often beats manual optimization
4. **Measure everything**: "Obvious" optimizations frequently backfire
5. **Profile-guided is better**: All experiments were theory-driven; real profiling might reveal different bottlenecks
6. **Algorithmic parallelism wins**: True SIMD batching succeeds where single-hand optimizations fail
7. **Measurement methodology is critical**: Heavy instrumentation can cause 3x overhead, completely misleading results

## Experiment 10: Context-Aware Showdown Batching

**Performance Impact**: 3.1× faster (41.9 → 13.4 ns/eval) on 320K hero/villain comparisons sharing the same board
**Complexity**: Medium
**Status**: ✅ Success

**Approach**: Reuse board metadata and evaluate many hero/villain pairs at once. Instead of reassembling full 7-card hands per pair, precompute suit/rank counts with `BoardContext`, then pack up to 32 hero/villain pairs into vectors and call `evaluateBatch` for both sides, comparing ranks lane-by-lane.

**Implementation**:

- Added `BoardContext` helper exports (`initBoardContext`, `evaluateHoleWithContext`, `evaluateShowdownWithContext`) so callers can precompute board state once.
- Introduced `evaluateShowdownBatch` to process chunks of 32/16/8/4/2/1 pairs, combining the shared board mask with each hole mask and comparing SIMD rank vectors.
- Extended `poker-eval bench --showdown` to report context vs. batched timings and added regression tests ensuring batch results match the single context path.

**Benchmark** (`zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`, Apple M1):

```
poker-eval bench --showdown --iterations 320000
Context path: 41.92 ns/eval
Batched path: 13.42 ns/eval
Speedup:      3.12×
```

**Why it worked**: BoardContext eliminates redundant suit/rank recomputation, and batching keeps the SIMD evaluator saturated. The cost of packing 32 pairs is amortized across the vector work, turning the showdown comparator into a memory-friendly, cache-resident loop with minimal scalar overhead.
