# Performance Optimization Experiments

**Original Baseline** (pre-SIMD): 11.95 ns/hand (83.7M hands/s)
**After SIMD Batching** (Exp 6): 4.5 ns/hand (224M hands/s) - 2.66× speedup
**After SIMD Flush Detection** (Exp 12): 3.69 ns/hand (271M hands/s) - 3.24× speedup
**Current** (Exp 13): **3.27 ns/hand (306M hands/s)** - Flush pattern lookup table

**Showdown Baseline**: 41.9 ns/eval (context path, 5-card board + two holes)
**Showdown Current** (Exp 10): 13.4 ns/eval (batched, board context + SIMD), 3.1× faster

**Total Speedup**: 3.65× from original baseline (11.95ns → 3.27ns)

## Experiment 1: Packed ARM64 Tables

**Performance Impact**: +5.9% slower (12.65→11.95 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: High
**Status**: ❌ Failed

**Approach**: Pack two 13-bit hand ranks into each u32 table entry to halve memory footprint on ARM64. Added architecture detection in build_tables.zig and dual table formats with bit manipulation for extraction.

**Implementation**:

- Modified CHD value table from `[CHD_TABLE_SIZE]u16` to `[CHD_TABLE_SIZE/2]u32`
- Added `unpack_rank_arm64()` function with bit shifts and masks
- Conditional table generation based on target architecture

**Why it failed**: Complexity overhead outweighed theoretical memory benefits. The 267KB working set already fits comfortably in L2 cache, so halving it provided no cache benefit. The bit manipulation added CPU cycles without reducing memory pressure.

## Experiment 2: Memory Prefetching

**Performance Impact**: +9.4% slower (13.07→11.95 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Status**: ❌ Failed

**Approach**: Add `@prefetch` instructions in batch evaluation loops to hint upcoming memory accesses to the CPU cache system.

**Implementation**:

```zig
@prefetch(&tables.chd_value_table[final_index], .{});
```

**Why it failed**: The 267KB table working set is cache-resident, not memory-bound. Prefetch hints added overhead without improving cache hit rates. The evaluator is compute-bound, not memory-bound.

## Experiment 3: Simplified Hash Function

**Performance Impact**: +3.2% slower (12.33→11.95 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: Low
**Status**: ❌ Failed

**Approach**: Replace 3-step Murmur-style hash with single multiply and shift for faster hash computation.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// Original: mix64 (3 operations)
result ^= result >> 33;
result *%= MAGIC_CONSTANT;
result ^= result >> 29;

// Simplified: fast_hash (1 operation)
return (x * 0x9e3779b97f4a7c15) >> 13;
```

**Why it failed**: The original 3-step hash has better distribution and instruction-level parallelism. Modern CPUs can pipeline the three operations effectively, while the simpler hash created more collisions in the CHD displacement array.

## Experiment 4: RPC Bit Manipulation

**Performance Impact**: +7.4% slower (12.83→11.95 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Status**: ❌ Failed

**Approach**: Replace nested loops (4 suits × 13 ranks = 52 iterations) with unrolled bit manipulation to count rank occurrences.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// Original: nested loops
for (0..4) |suit| {
    for (0..13) |rank| {
        if ((suit_mask & (1 << rank)) != 0) rank_counts[rank] += 1;
    }
}

// Optimized: unrolled with inline for
inline for (0..13) |rank| {
    if (suits[0] & rank_bit != 0) count += 1;
    if (suits[1] & rank_bit != 0) count += 1;
    // ... unrolled for all 4 suits
}
```

**Why it failed**: Zig's compiler already optimizes the nested loops effectively. Manual unrolling added code complexity and register pressure without improving the generated assembly. The simple nested loops have better instruction cache locality.

## Experiment 5: LUT-Based RPC Computation

**Performance Impact**: +10.2% slower (14.10→12.79 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: High
**Status**: ❌ Failed

**Approach**: Replace 52-iteration rank counting loop with O(1) lookup tables, based on o3-pro analysis and comprehensive profiling that identified RPC computation as consuming 98% of runtime.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// Original: 52-iteration nested loops
for (0..4) |suit| {
    for (0..13) |rank| {
        if ((suit_mask & (1 << rank)) != 0) rank_counts[rank] += 1;
    }
}

// LUT approach: O(1) bit manipulation
inline for (0..13) |rank| {
    const rank_bit = 1 << rank;
    const count = @popCount(
        (if (clubs & rank_bit != 0) 1 else 0) |
        (if (diamonds & rank_bit != 0) 1 else 0) << 1 |
        // ... for all suits
    );
    rpc = rpc * 5 + count;
}
```

**Research phase**: Generated 768-byte rank delta lookup tables, implemented comprehensive validation (100K hands), and used high-frequency profiling (3,886 samples) to confirm RPC computation bottleneck.

**Why it failed**: Despite being "O(1)" in theory, the bit manipulation approach had higher per-operation overhead than the simple nested loops. Zig's compiler already optimizes the original loops with excellent auto-vectorization and instruction scheduling. The complex bit operations caused register pressure and defeated compiler optimizations. This reinforced the core lesson: **simple code + compiler optimization often beats manual micro-optimizations**.

## Experiment 6: SIMD Batching (4-Hand Parallel)

**Performance Impact**: +60% faster (11.95→~4.5 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: High
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS

**Approach**: Process 4 poker hands simultaneously using true SIMD parallelism with ARM64 NEON via Zig @Vector types, rather than optimizing single-hand computation.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// Structure-of-arrays for SIMD processing
const Hands4 = struct {
    clubs: @Vector(4, u16),
    diamonds: @Vector(4, u16),
    hearts: @Vector(4, u16),
    spades: @Vector(4, u16),
};

// Vectorized rank counting
fn compute_rpc_simd4(hands4: Hands4) @Vector(4, u32) {
    var rpc_vec: @Vector(4, u32) = @splat(0);

    inline for (0..13) |rank| {
        const rank_bit: @Vector(4, u16) = @splat(@as(u16, 1) << @intCast(rank));
        const zero_vec: @Vector(4, u16) = @splat(0);

        // Count rank occurrences across all suits (vectorized)
        const clubs_has = @select(u8, (hands4.clubs & rank_bit) != zero_vec, one_vec, zero_u8_vec);
        const diamonds_has = @select(u8, (hands4.diamonds & rank_bit) != zero_vec, one_vec, zero_u8_vec);
        const hearts_has = @select(u8, (hands4.hearts & rank_bit) != zero_vec, one_vec, zero_u8_vec);
        const spades_has = @select(u8, (hands4.spades & rank_bit) != zero_vec, one_vec, zero_u8_vec);

        const rank_count_vec = clubs_has + diamonds_has + hearts_has + spades_has;

        // Vectorized base-5 encoding
        const five_vec: @Vector(4, u32) = @splat(5);
        rpc_vec = rpc_vec * five_vec + @as(@Vector(4, u32), rank_count_vec);
    }

    return rpc_vec;
}
```

**Benchmark Results**: 3.2M hands (100K batches of 32)

- **Single-hand**: 8.67 ns/hand (115.4 M hands/sec)
- **32-hand batch**: ~4.5 ns/hand (224M+ hands/sec)
- **Speedup**: 1.93x
- **Checksums**: Identical (correctness verified)

**Why it succeeded**: Instead of fighting compiler optimizations with single-hand complexity, leveraged algorithmic parallelism. ARM64 NEON SIMD units can genuinely process 4 values simultaneously, providing true throughput multiplication. The structure-of-arrays layout enables efficient vectorization of the rank counting bottleneck.

**Key insight**: All previous experiments failed because they added complexity to already-optimized single-hand code. This experiment succeeded by changing the **algorithm** from "optimize 1 hand" to "process 4 hands in parallel" - working with SIMD strengths rather than against compiler optimizations.

## Experiment 7: 8-Hand SIMD Batching

**Performance Impact**: -16% slower (7.11→8.58 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: High
**Status**: ❌ Failed

**Approach**: Scale successful 4-hand SIMD batching to 8-hand batching to further amortize fixed overhead costs across more hands per operation.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// 8-hand structure-of-arrays using 2×4-wide vectors
fn compute_rpc_simd8(hands: [8]u64) [8]u32 {
    // Use two 4-wide vectors for 8 hands
    const clubs_v0: @Vector(4, u16) = clubs[0..4].*;
    const clubs_v1: @Vector(4, u16) = clubs[4..8].*;
    // ... similar for diamonds, hearts, spades

    var rpc_vec0: @Vector(4, u32) = @splat(0);
    var rpc_vec1: @Vector(4, u32) = @splat(0);

    // Vectorized rank counting on both vector pairs
    inline for (0..13) |rank| {
        // Process both 4-hand groups in parallel
        const rank_count_vec0 = clubs_has0 + diamonds_has0 + hearts_has0 + spades_has0;
        const rank_count_vec1 = clubs_has1 + diamonds_has1 + hearts_has1 + spades_has1;

        rpc_vec0 = rpc_vec0 * five_vec + @as(@Vector(4, u32), rank_count_vec0);
        rpc_vec1 = rpc_vec1 * five_vec + @as(@Vector(4, u32), rank_count_vec1);
    }

    // Combine results from both vector groups
    return [8]u32{ result0[0], result0[1], result0[2], result0[3],
                   result1[0], result1[1], result1[2], result1[3] };
}
```

**Benchmark Results**: Per batch processing

- **32-hand batching**: ~4.5 ns/hand (224M+ hands/sec)
- **64-hand batching**: 4.31 ns/hand (232.0M hands/sec)
- **Performance**: Only 3.5% improvement, not worth the complexity

**Why it failed**: Register pressure and complexity overhead outweighed the theoretical benefits of larger batch sizes. M1's NEON architecture is optimized for 4-wide operations; doubling to 8-wide required managing twice as many vectors without proportional ALU resources. The additional vector management, memory layout complexity, and register spilling defeated the amortization benefits.

**Detailed analysis**:

- **Register pressure**: 8-hand processing requires ~16 SIMD registers vs 8 for 4-hand
- **Memory access patterns**: More complex structure-of-arrays layout hurt cache efficiency
- **Instruction cache pressure**: Larger unrolled loops increased I-cache misses
- **Flush fallback amplification**: 2.4% flush probability means 8-hand batches hit scalar fallback more often

**Key insight**: The "sweet spot" for SIMD batch size is architecture-dependent. ARM64 NEON's 4-wide design makes 4-hand batching optimal; scaling beyond this hits diminishing returns from resource constraints rather than algorithmic improvements.

## Experiment 8: Flush Fallback Elimination

**Performance Impact**: Neutral on mixed workload, significant improvement on flush-heavy batches
**Complexity**: Low
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS

**Approach**: Eliminate scalar fallback when batches contain mixed flush/non-flush hands by keeping SIMD pipeline active for non-flush hands and handling flush hands per-lane.

**Problem**: Previous implementation fell back to scalar evaluation for entire 4-hand batch if ANY hand was a flush (9.3% probability), wasting SIMD work on 3 non-flush hands.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// Detect flush hands but preserve SIMD pipeline
var flush_mask: u4 = 0;
for (hands_array, 0..) |hand, i| {
    if (is_flush_hand(hand)) {
        flush_mask |= (@as(u4, 1) << @intCast(i));
    }
}

// Always run SIMD path for RPC computation (amortizes cost)
const rpc_results = compute_rpc_simd4(hands_array);

// Per-lane result selection based on flush detection
inline for (0..4) |i| {
    if (flush_mask & (@as(u4, 1) << @intCast(i)) != 0) {
        // Flush hand - use flush lookup table
        const pattern = get_flush_pattern(hands_array[i]);
        results[i] = tables.flush_lookup_table[pattern];
    } else {
        // Non-flush hand - use CHD lookup with SIMD-computed RPC
        results[i] = chd_lookup_scalar(rpc_results[i]);
    }
}
```

**Benchmark Results**:

- **Mixed workload**: ~4.5 ns/hand (maintained performance)
- **Flush-heavy batch**: Minimal regression due to per-lane handling
- **Pure non-flush batch**: Optimal ~4.5 ns/hand performance

**Why it succeeded**: Eliminated 9.3% scalar penalty for mixed batches while maintaining SIMD efficiency. The approach respects ARM64 architecture constraints and avoids complexity tax by using simple per-lane selection rather than vectorized flush handling.

**Key insight**: Strategic fallback elimination can provide targeted improvements without adding architectural complexity. The SIMD pipeline investment is preserved even when some lanes require different processing paths.

## Experiment 9: Measurement Methodology Discovery (Reverted)

**Performance Impact**: Neutral - no real improvement, heavy measurement artifacts
**Complexity**: High
**Status**: ❌ Reverted - complexity without benefits

**Critical discovery**: Heavy timing instrumentation caused **~22 ns/hand measurement overhead** (3x actual performance), completely misleading optimization efforts.

**Key lesson**: Always measure production performance without debugging/profiling overhead. "Heisenberg's uncertainty principle" applies to performance measurement.

## Key Learnings

1. **Memory optimizations fail**: Working set (267KB) is cache-resident, not memory-bound
2. **Complexity tax is real**: Small theoretical gains eaten by implementation overhead
3. **Compiler knows best**: Auto-vectorization + simple code often beats manual optimization
4. **Measure everything**: "Obvious" optimizations frequently backfire
5. **Profile-guided is better**: All experiments were theory-driven; real profiling might reveal different bottlenecks
6. **Algorithmic parallelism wins**: True SIMD batching succeeds where single-hand optimizations fail
7. **Measurement methodology is critical**: Heavy instrumentation can cause 3x overhead, completely misleading results

## Experiment 10: Context-Aware Showdown Batching

**Performance Impact**: 3.1× faster (41.9 → 13.4 ns/eval) on 320K hero/villain comparisons sharing the same board
**Complexity**: Medium
**Status**: ✅ Success

**Approach**: Reuse board metadata and evaluate many hero/villain pairs at once. Instead of reassembling full 7-card hands per pair, precompute suit/rank counts with `BoardContext`, then pack up to 32 hero/villain pairs into vectors and call `evaluateBatch` for both sides, comparing ranks lane-by-lane.

**Implementation**:

- Added `BoardContext` helper exports (`initBoardContext`, `evaluateHoleWithContext`, `evaluateShowdownWithContext`) so callers can precompute board state once.
- Introduced `evaluateShowdownBatch` to process chunks of 32/16/8/4/2/1 pairs, combining the shared board mask with each hole mask and comparing SIMD rank vectors.
- Extended `poker-eval bench --showdown` to report context vs. batched timings and added regression tests ensuring batch results match the single context path.

**Benchmark** (`zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`, Apple M1):

```
poker-eval bench --showdown --iterations 320000
Context path: 41.92 ns/eval
Batched path: 13.42 ns/eval
Speedup:      3.12×
```

**Why it worked**: BoardContext eliminates redundant suit/rank recomputation, and batching keeps the SIMD evaluator saturated. The cost of packing 32 pairs is amortized across the vector work, turning the showdown comparator into a memory-friendly, cache-resident loop with minimal scalar overhead.

## Experiment 11: Force Inline Hot Path Functions

**Performance Impact**: Neutral (4.35→4.38 ns/hand, within measurement noise)
**Complexity**: Trivial
**Status**: ❌ No improvement (compiler already optimizing)

**Approach**: Add explicit `inline` keywords to frequently-called functions `isFlushHand()` and `chdLookupScalar()` to eliminate potential function call overhead in the batch evaluation loop.

**Hypothesis**: Based on deep analysis, scalar function call overhead for 32 calls/batch to these functions was theorized to represent 30-40% of evaluation time. Expected 20-35% speedup if compiler wasn't already inlining.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// src/evaluator.zig:298
inline fn chdLookupScalar(rpc: u32) u16 {
    return tables.lookup(rpc);
}

// src/evaluator.zig:304
pub inline fn isFlushHand(hand: u64) bool {
    const suits = [4]u16{
        @as(u16, @truncate(hand >> 0)) & RANK_MASK,
        @as(u16, @truncate(hand >> 13)) & RANK_MASK,
        @as(u16, @truncate(hand >> 26)) & RANK_MASK,
        @as(u16, @truncate(hand >> 39)) & RANK_MASK,
    };
    for (suits) |suit_mask| {
        if (@popCount(suit_mask) >= 5) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Benchmark Results**: 100K iterations, ReleaseFast

- **Baseline**: 4.35 ns/hand (229.8M hands/sec)
- **With inline**: 4.37-4.38 ns/hand (228.1-228.8M hands/sec)
- **Change**: +0.7% slower (within measurement noise)
- **Tests**: All 78 tests passed

**Why it failed**: The Zig compiler (with LLVM backend) was **already automatically inlining** these functions at ReleaseFast optimization level. Adding explicit `inline` keywords provided no benefit because the optimizer had already identified these as hot-path functions worthy of inlining. The performance difference is within normal measurement variance.

**Key insight**: Modern optimizing compilers (LLVM) are highly effective at identifying hot paths and making inlining decisions. The performance profile was already optimal without manual intervention. This validates that the current 4.5ns/hand performance represents a genuine ceiling imposed by:
1. **Memory latency** for CHD table lookups (2 dependent loads per hand)
2. **Amdahl's Law** limiting further speedup when 30% of work is inherently scalar

**Conclusion**: The evaluator is **already operating near its theoretical performance limit** for the current algorithm. Further improvements require algorithmic changes (e.g., SIMD flush detection) rather than micro-optimizations that the compiler already handles.

## Experiment 12: SIMD Flush Detection

**Performance Impact**: +15.2% faster (4.35→3.69 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS

**Approach**: Vectorize the 32 scalar `isFlushHand()` calls in the batch evaluation loop using SIMD @popCount operations to detect flush hands across the entire batch simultaneously.

**Motivation**: Profiling with uniprof (20M iterations) revealed that `isFlushHand()` accounted for 6-7% of execution time despite being inlined. The batch evaluation loop made 32 scalar calls per batch, each extracting suits and checking @popCount individually.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// New SIMD flush detection function (src/evaluator.zig:305)
fn detectFlushSimd(comptime batchSize: usize, hands: *const [batchSize]u64) [batchSize]bool {
    // Extract suits for all hands (structure-of-arrays)
    var clubs: [batchSize]u16 = undefined;
    var diamonds: [batchSize]u16 = undefined;
    var hearts: [batchSize]u16 = undefined;
    var spades: [batchSize]u16 = undefined;

    for (hands, 0..) |hand, i| {
        clubs[i] = @as(u16, @truncate((hand >> 0) & RANK_MASK));
        diamonds[i] = @as(u16, @truncate((hand >> 13) & RANK_MASK));
        hearts[i] = @as(u16, @truncate((hand >> 26) & RANK_MASK));
        spades[i] = @as(u16, @truncate((hand >> 39) & RANK_MASK));
    }

    // Vectorized popcount for each suit
    const clubs_v: @Vector(batchSize, u16) = clubs;
    const diamonds_v: @Vector(batchSize, u16) = diamonds;
    const hearts_v: @Vector(batchSize, u16) = hearts;
    const spades_v: @Vector(batchSize, u16) = spades;

    const clubs_count = @popCount(clubs_v);
    const diamonds_count = @popCount(diamonds_v);
    const hearts_count = @popCount(hearts_v);
    const spades_count = @popCount(spades_v);

    const threshold: @Vector(batchSize, u16) = @splat(5);

    // Check if any suit has >= 5 cards (vectorized comparison)
    const clubs_flush = clubs_count >= threshold;
    const diamonds_flush = diamonds_count >= threshold;
    const hearts_flush = hearts_count >= threshold;
    const spades_flush = spades_count >= threshold;

    // Combine results using bitwise OR (any suit with >= 5 means flush)
    const has_flush = clubs_flush | diamonds_flush | hearts_flush | spades_flush;

    // Convert vector to array
    var result: [batchSize]bool = [_]bool{false} ** batchSize;
    inline for (0..batchSize) |i| {
        result[i] = has_flush[i];
    }
    return result;
}

// Modified evaluateBatch (src/evaluator.zig:446)
pub fn evaluateBatch(comptime batchSize: usize, hands: @Vector(batchSize, u64)) @Vector(batchSize, u16) {
    var hands_array: [batchSize]u64 = undefined;
    inline for (0..batchSize) |i| { hands_array[i] = hands[i]; }

    // Compute RPC for all hands (SIMD-optimized)
    const rpc_results = computeRpcSimd(batchSize, &hands_array);

    // Detect flush hands in batch (NEW: SIMD-optimized)
    const flush_mask = detectFlushSimd(batchSize, &hands_array);

    // Evaluate using pre-computed flush detection
    var results: [batchSize]u16 = undefined;
    inline for (0..batchSize) |i| {
        if (flush_mask[i]) {
            results[i] = tables.flushLookup(getFlushPattern(hands_array[i]));
        } else {
            results[i] = chdLookupScalar(rpc_results[i]);
        }
    }

    return @as(@Vector(batchSize, u16), results);
}
```

**Benchmark Results**: 100K iterations, ReleaseFast, Apple M1

- **Baseline (Experiment 11)**: 4.35 ns/hand (230M hands/sec)
- **With SIMD flush detection**: 3.69 ns/hand (271M hands/sec)
- **Improvement**: 15.2% faster (0.66 ns/hand reduction)
- **Consistency**: 3 runs: 3.66, 3.78, 3.62 ns/hand (CV: ~2%)
- **Tests**: All 78 tests passed

**Why it succeeded**: The profiling correctly identified flush detection as a 6-7% bottleneck. By extracting suits once for all 32 hands and using ARM64 NEON's vectorized @popCount instruction, we eliminated 32 scalar function calls and 128 individual @popCount operations (4 suits × 32 hands). The SIMD approach processes all hands' suit counts in parallel, achieving true data parallelism.

**Key insight**: Profile-guided optimization pays off. The uniprof profiling data (16,388 samples showing `isFlushHand` at line 313 consuming 6-7% of time) provided concrete evidence for this optimization target. The actual 15.2% improvement exceeded the predicted 6-7% because the SIMD approach also improved instruction cache utilization and reduced branch mispredictions.

**Technical details**:
- Uses ARM64 NEON `CNT` instruction for vectorized population count
- Bitwise OR (`|`) operator combines boolean vectors (Zig requirement)
- Supports batch sizes: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 (powers of 2)
- Fallback to scalar for other batch sizes

**Current performance ceiling**: At 3.69 ns/hand, we're approaching the theoretical limit:
- Memory latency (CHD lookups): ~2.0-2.5 ns/hand (unavoidable)
- Remaining computation: ~1.2-1.7 ns/hand
- Further improvements limited by Amdahl's Law with ~70% memory-bound work

## Experiment 13: Flush Pattern Lookup Table

**Performance Impact**: +11.4% faster (3.69→3.27 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS

**Approach**: Replace branching and iteration in `getTop5Ranks()` with a compile-time lookup table that pre-computes the top-5 flush pattern for all 65,536 possible suit masks.

**Motivation**: Profiling with uniprof revealed that `getTop5Ranks()` consumed 5.26% of execution time despite being called only for flush hands (~20% of hands). The function had three code paths: exact-5-cards (fast path), straight detection (10 iterations), and rank iteration (up to 13 iterations). Analysis identified this as the largest non-memory bottleneck.

**Implementation**:

```zig
// Compile-time lookup table generation (src/evaluator.zig:48)
const flush_top5_table: [65536]u16 = blk: {
    @setEvalBranchQuota(2000000); // Need higher quota for 65K table generation
    var table: [65536]u16 = [_]u16{0} ** 65536;

    // Compute top 5 pattern for every possible suit mask
    for (0..65536) |mask_int| {
        const suit_mask: u16 = @intCast(mask_int);
        const bit_count = @popCount(suit_mask);

        // Only valid for 5-7 card flushes
        if (bit_count < 5 or bit_count > 7) {
            table[mask_int] = 0; // Invalid input, never called
            continue;
        }

        // Fast path: exactly 5 bits set
        if (bit_count == 5) {
            table[mask_int] = suit_mask;
            continue;
        }

        // Check for straights
        const straights = [_]u16{
            0x1F00, 0x0F80, 0x07C0, 0x03E0, 0x01F0,
            0x00F8, 0x007C, 0x003E, 0x001F, 0x100F, // wheel
        };

        var is_straight = false;
        for (straights) |pattern| {
            if ((suit_mask & pattern) == pattern) {
                table[mask_int] = pattern;
                is_straight = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (is_straight) continue;

**Benchmark Results**: 20M iterations (640M hands), ReleaseFast, Apple M1

- **Baseline (Experiment 12)**: 3.69 ns/hand (271M hands/sec)
- **With lookup table**: 3.27 ns/hand (306M hands/sec)
- **Improvement**: 11.4% faster (0.42 ns/hand reduction)
- **Consistency**: 3 runs: 3.26, 3.28, 3.28 ns/hand (CV: 0.4%)
- **Tests**: All 78 tests passed

**Why it succeeded**: The lookup table eliminates all branching and iteration in flush pattern extraction. Instead of checking for exact-5-cards, iterating through 10 straight patterns, then potentially iterating through 13 ranks, the function now performs a single array lookup. The 128KB table (65,536 × 2 bytes) is generated at compile-time and adds minimal cache pressure since the CHD tables (267KB) already force L2 cache usage.

**Key insight**: Profile-guided optimization continues to deliver results. The 5.26% profiling hotspot translated to an 11.4% improvement - the additional gain comes from:
1. Eliminating branch mispredictions (3 code paths → 1)
2. Reducing instruction cache pressure (complex loop logic → simple load)
3. Enabling better instruction pipelining (no data-dependent branching)

**Technical details**:
- Table size: 128KB (65,536 entries × 2 bytes per u16)
- Memory impact: Total working set now 395KB (267KB CHD + 128KB flush patterns)
- Cache behavior: Already L2-bound, minimal additional pressure
- Compile-time generation: Requires `@setEvalBranchQuota(2000000)` for table computation
- All possible suit masks pre-computed (valid inputs: 5-7 bits set)

**Performance analysis**:
- Current: 3.27 ns/hand (306M hands/sec)
- Theoretical ceiling: ~2.5 ns/hand (memory-bound CHD lookups)
- Remaining headroom: 0.77ns (23%)
- Further optimization limited by Amdahl's Law (~70% memory-bound work)

## Experiment 14: Reuse Suit Extraction

**Performance Impact**: -1.8% slower (3.27→3.33 ns/hand)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Status**: ❌ FAILED

**Approach**: Eliminate redundant suit extraction by having `detectFlushSimd` return extracted suit data alongside the flush mask, allowing flush pattern evaluation to reuse this data instead of re-extracting suits in `getFlushPattern`.

**Motivation**: Analysis identified that suits are extracted twice per batch:
1. Once in `detectFlushSimd` for flush detection (~370-391 in evaluator.zig)
2. Again in `getFlushPattern` for each flush hand (~440-467)

For batch-32 with ~20% flush rate (~6 flush hands), this meant 24 redundant suit extractions (4 shifts + 4 masks each).

**Implementation**:

```zig
// New struct to return both flush mask and suit data
fn FlushDetectionResult(comptime batchSize: usize) type {
    return struct {
        flush_mask: [batchSize]bool,
        suits: [batchSize][4]u16, // Suits for reuse in flush evaluation
    };
}

// Modified detectFlushSimd to return suit data
fn detectFlushSimdWithSuits(comptime batchSize: usize, hands: *const [batchSize]u64) FlushDetectionResult(batchSize) {
    var result = FlushDetectionResult(batchSize){
        .flush_mask = [_]bool{false} ** batchSize,
        .suits = [_][4]u16{[_]u16{0} ** 4} ** batchSize,
    };

    // ... existing suit extraction logic ...

    // Store both results and suit data
    inline for (0..batchSize) |i| {
        result.flush_mask[i] = has_flush[i];
        result.suits[i] = [4]u16{ clubs[i], diamonds[i], hearts[i], spades[i] };
    }

    return result;
}

// New helper to get flush pattern from pre-extracted suits
inline fn getFlushPatternFromSuits(suits: [4]u16) u16 {
    for (suits) |suit_mask| {
        if (@popCount(suit_mask) >= 5) {
            return getTop5Ranks(suit_mask);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

// Modified evaluateBatch to use pre-extracted suits
pub fn evaluateBatch(comptime batchSize: usize, hands: @Vector(batchSize, u64)) @Vector(batchSize, u16) {
    const flush_detection = detectFlushSimdWithSuits(batchSize, &hands_array);

    inline for (0..batchSize) |i| {
        if (flush_detection.flush_mask[i]) {
            const pattern = getFlushPatternFromSuits(flush_detection.suits[i]);
            results[i] = tables.flushLookup(pattern);
        } else {
            results[i] = chdLookupScalar(rpc_results[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

**Benchmark Results**: 20M+ iterations, ReleaseFast, Apple M1

- **Baseline (Experiment 13)**: 3.27 ns/hand (306M hands/sec)
- **With suit reuse**: 3.33 ns/hand (300M hands/sec)
- **Performance**: 1.8% slower (0.06 ns/hand regression)
- **Consistency**: 3 runs: 3.33, 3.33, 3.34 ns/hand
- **Tests**: All 78 tests passed

**Why it failed**: The overhead of allocating and returning a larger struct outweighed the benefit of eliminating redundant suit extraction. Root causes:

1. **Stack allocation overhead**: The `FlushDetectionResult` struct requires 256 bytes for batch-32 (32 hands × 4 suits × 2 bytes). This stack allocation and initialization cost exceeded the savings from eliminating suit extraction.

2. **Wasted work**: Suit data is stored for all 32 hands but only used for ~6 flush hands (~20% of batch). The remaining ~26 non-flush hands pay the storage cost without benefit.

3. **Register pressure**: Returning a larger struct likely caused register spilling or less efficient register allocation in the hot path.

4. **Memory bandwidth**: Storing 256 bytes per batch to save 24 suit extractions (96 bytes of shifts/masks) increased memory traffic rather than reducing it.

**Key insight**: **Premature data reuse can hurt performance**. While eliminating redundant computation sounds beneficial, the overhead of preserving and passing data structures can exceed the savings. The original design's "extract on demand" approach was actually more efficient because:
- Suit extraction for 6 flush hands (24 operations) is cheaper than allocating/storing/passing 256 bytes
- Compiler can optimize the redundant extraction better than managing the larger struct
- Cache pressure from larger stack frames outweighs computation savings

**Theoretical vs. actual**: The analysis correctly identified redundant work (suits extracted twice), but failed to account for:
- Cost of struct allocation and passing
- Efficiency of modern compilers at optimizing small, repeated operations
- Cache/memory hierarchy effects of larger data structures

**Conclusion**: At 3.27 ns/hand, we've reached a **practical performance ceiling**. The evaluator is 77% of theoretical maximum (2.5 ns/hand), with remaining time dominated by unavoidable CHD memory lookups. Further micro-optimizations face diminishing returns where implementation overhead exceeds theoretical savings.
